                    "A recipe app is one that you use daily and what we in our family
                    call 'a living book' — a book that you use all the time,
                    not just read once and discard on the shelf.
                    Recipes are by nature derivative and meant to be shared -
                    that is how they improve, are changed, how new ideas are formed. ”
